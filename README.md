_Animated folding tree view for Forest_

This project is part of [Forest](https://github.com/tehwalris/forest) (a tree editor for TypeScript) - you can see it in action there.

**This project is not maintained for use without Forest.** If you still want to build something with it, there's a standalone demo application in the `divetree-demo` folder.
